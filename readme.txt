This repository will be used for trying out git rebase and get a hands on git.
Step 1: Add few commit on the main branch, minimum 3 commits
Step 2: Create new branch, commit at least two new changes on new branch. Now feature branch is ahead of 2 commits from main branch
Step 3: Add new commit to main branch
Step 4: Repeat these steps because we need to understand rebase and pull request and Stash operation helps to save local changes temporarily without commit
Step 5: Pop your stash changes and apply
Step 6: Create pull request for the pushed branch and merge pull request
Step 7: Rebasing feature on top of main branch
Step 8: Merge
